            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>When I was a political scientist, I researched 
                how systems of people learn. So, while it might not seem a normal transition, 
                I personally see moving into software engineering as a natural move into a different 
                field in information processing. I have always been interested in how information moves 
                through systems, and now I want to help build systems instead of just studying them.
